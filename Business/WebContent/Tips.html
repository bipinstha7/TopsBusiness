  <h4>Buying Products</h4><p>Being a buyer first thing you should consider is quality. Quality product with good price is considerd to be a good products.
  Let's face it, there's every reason in the world to shop online. The bargains are there. The selection is mind-boggling. The shopping is secure. 
  Shipping is fast. Even returns are pretty easy, with the right e-tailers. Shopping has never been easier or more convenient for consumers.</p>
  <h4>Hints for Buying</h4>
  	<p><strong>1. USE A SECURE WIFI OR INTERNET CONNECTION</strong>
	Although it is comfortable and easy to browse and buy through public networks, malls or stores, the truth is that these networks are often unreliable.
 	The information packets transmitted over public connections can be captured easily by hackers and cybercriminals. 
 	For this reason, to make purchases or transactions in which you transfer personal information, we recommend that you go through a secure network.
  	</p><p><strong>2. KEEP YOUR COMPUTER UPDATED AND PROTECTED</strong>
	Online shopping is one of the processes in which more personal and dangerous information is transferred. 
	For that reason, before you start shopping, make sure you have your computer secure, updated and equipped with a good antivirus product.
  	</p><p><strong>3.  Look for the Lock</strong>
    Never ever, ever buy anything online using your credit card from a site that doesn't have SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption installed-at the very least. 
    You'll know if the site has SSL because the URL for the site will start with HTTPS:// (instead of just HTTP://). 
	An icon of a locked padlock will appear, typically in the status bar at the bottom of your web browser, or right next to the URL in the address bar. 
	It depends on your browser.
	Never, ever give anyone your credit card over email. Ever.
	</p><p><strong>4.  Check Statements</strong>
	Don't wait for your bill to come at the end of the month. Go online regularly during the holiday season and look at electronic statements for your credit card, 
	debit card, and checking accounts. Make sure you don't see any fraudulent charges, even originating from sites like PayPal. 
	(After all, there's more than one way to get to your money.)If you do see something wrong, pick up the phone to address the matter quickly. 
	In the case of credit cards, pay the bill only once you know all your charges are accurate. You have 30 days to notify the bank or card issuer of problems, 
	however; after that, you might be liable for the charges anyway.
	</p><p><strong>5.  Use Strong Passwords</strong>
	 like to beat this dead horse about making sure to utilize uncrackable passwords, but it's never more important than when banking and shopping online. 
	Our tips for creating a unique password can come in handy during a time of year when shopping around probably means creating new accounts on all sorts of e-commerce sites.
	</p><p><strong>6.  Avoid Public Terminals</strong>
	Hopefully we don't have to tell you it's a bad idea to use a public computer to make purchases, but we still will. 
	If you do, just remember to log out every time you use a public terminal, even if you were just checking email.
	about using your own laptop to shop while you're out? It's one thing to hand over a credit card to get swiped at the checkout,
	but when you must enter the number and expiration date on a website while sitting in a public cafe, you're giving an over-the-shoulder snooper plenty of time to see the goods. 
	At the very least, think like a gangster: Sit in the back, facing the door.
	</p><p><strong>7.  Know What's Too Good to Be True</strong>
	Once again, McAfee has compiled a Twelve Scams of Christmas list, all things to be aware of while shopping. 
	The "coupon scam" offers of a free product with purchase, in particular an iPad (a very coveted gadget at any holiday) or even holiday job offers. 
	Many of these "offers" will come in via social media. Beware even of your friends, who might innocently forward such a thing. 
	Be very wary even if you get a message from friend claiming he or she has been robbed, especially a friend overseas looking for money to be wire transferred, 
	unless you absolutely can confirm it by talking to him or her personally. Skepticism in most cases can go a long way toward saving you from a stolen card number.
